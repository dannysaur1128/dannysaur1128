Hi! My name is Daniel Joung and I am currently a 3rd year at Northeastern studying Business administration with a concentration in Finance, as well as a minor in data science.
I am hoping to pursue some sort of occupation which either incorporates aspects of finance or coding, and analyzing data as well.
